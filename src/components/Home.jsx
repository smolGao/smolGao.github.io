        Hello! I'm Wenjie Gao, a passionate and driven computer science graduate from Temple University. Throughout my academic
        journey, I've honed my skills in coding, problem-solving, and software
        development, gaining a deep understanding of various programming
        languages and technologies. I'm actively looking for projects and
        internships to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios and
        collaborate with diverse teams to deliver innovative solutions. With a
        solid foundation in computer science principles and a hunger for
        continuous learning, I'm excited to embark on the next chapter of my
        career to leverage my expertise to tackle complex challenges and make
        meaningful contributions to the tech industry.
